# lostOS
My first real operating system using C and Assembly. I use cfenollosa/os-tutorial to make this.
I added my own commands too.

## Please read this installation list or else you can't run the system! </br>

1) MSYS2 \ UCRT64 (Windows).  <a href="https://msys2.org">Download link here</a>
2) QEMU System. Download it by typing `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qemu`
3) i386-elf Toolchain for UCRT64 (Windows). <a href="https://github.com/nativeos/i386-elf-toolchain/releases">Download link here</a>

If you guys don't know how to get place the i386 elf into UCRT64... (I will continue soon)
