# lostOS
My first real operating system using C and Assembly. I use github cfenollosa/os-tutorial to make this.
I added other commands like ECHO, VER, CLEAR, WHOAMI.

## Please read this installation list or else you can't run the system! </br>

### For Windows user:
1) MSYS2 \ UCRT64 (Windows).  <a href="https://msys2.org">Download link here</a>
2) QEMU System. Type `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qemu` in the ucrt terminal to download.
3) i386-elf Toolchain for UCRT64 (Windows). <a href="https://github.com/nativeos/i386-elf-toolchain/releases">Download link here</a>
